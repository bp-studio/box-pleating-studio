# App

BP Studio App is in charge of the interactions outside the workspace area,
including the toolbar and the option panel.
It is mainly written in [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/).
It also initializes the [Client](../client/README.md).

We use [postcss-preset-env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-preset-env)
in this project, so we can directly use modern CSS syntax without
worrying about compatibilities.
