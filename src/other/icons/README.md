# Icons

This section is for those icons not provided by [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
The `src` folder contains the original SVG files,
and `dist` folder contains processed SVG
(mainly by converting strokes to fills)
files as well as the [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/app/) project JSON file.
The font file is then generated with IcoMoon and placed under `bps`.
