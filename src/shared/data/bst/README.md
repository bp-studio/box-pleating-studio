# BST (Binary Search Tree)

In this section we have the various implementations of a BST.

In the end,
the only implementation we actually used in BP Studio is the [RAVLTree](./ravlTree.ts),
but we've also kept other implementations for future references.

You may wonder if the inclusion of unnecessary class inheritance
in this context would lead to performance overhead.
However, experiments have demonstrated that simplifying the classes tailored
for our specific use case does not yield noticeable performance enhancements.
Therefore, we choose to keep things as they are,
in case we might want to use different implementations in other future use cases as well.
