## Version 0.4.0

New features:
- Edit menu, with undo/redo features (up to 30 steps). Editing history is saved if automatic session saving is on.
- Three new locales: 简体中文 (Simplified Chinese), Español (Spanish), Tiếng Việt (Vietnamese).
- "Check for update" feature.
- More hotkeys, and now also work on Mac.

Major Improvements:
- Performance is greatly improved, with project opening speed and rendering speed up to 3x faster.
- Remove BigInt dependency, which ensures backward compatibility for Safari less than version 14.
- Improve scaling and scrolling behavior for better user experience.
- Improve rendering on high DPI devices.

Changes:
- To avoid accidental drags, on touch devices selection would have to be made before one can drag the components. Mouse behavior on desktops remains the same (i.e. one can select and drag in one move).
- Absolute scaling is now replaced by relative zooming, in percentage. Zooming is not saved into project files, but is kept in session saving.
- All sharing URLs will now be shortened with TinyURL by default.

Bugs fixed:
- Fixed various known river rendering bugs in extreme cases.
- Fixed various UI bugs on iOS Safari.
