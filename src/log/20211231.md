## Version 0.5.0

New features:
- Native file access ability (on desktops and in Chromium-based browsers only for now), which allows the user to directly save into the file that was opened, and to keep file accessing history.
- New hotkeys: <kbd class="not-mac">Esc</kbd><kbd class="mac-only">⎋</kbd> to unselect all, <span class="not-mac"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+</span><kbd class="mac-only">⌘</kbd><kbd>1</kbd> to <kbd>6</kbd> to toggle display settings.
- Customizable hotkeys for various commands such as switching views, changing flap radius, and so on. You can now assign a regular input key (or combination with the <kbd class="not-mac">Shift</kbd><kbd class="mac-only">⇧</kbd> key) of your choice to any of these commands in the Preference dialog.
- New locale: 한국어.

Thanks to:
- Mr. 김영웅, for reviewing the Korean locale.
