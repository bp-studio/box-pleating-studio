# PolyBool algorithm

In this section,
we implemented a variation of the MartÃ­nez-Rueda-Feito algorithm,
described in their 2009 paper
[A New Algorithm for Computing Boolean Operations on Polygons](https://github.com/mfogel/polygon-clipping/blob/main/paper.pdf).

The implementation here is different from the original algorithm in a few ways:
1. It is optimized for dealing with polygons of very specific shapes not polygons in general.
   Most notably, in both use cases here,
   there is no need to check for new intersection between newly adjacent segments after an `EndEvent`.
   (Such checking is needed in general because the segments could form a `>>` formation,
   but that cannot happen in the use cases here.)
2. It handles all components at once, instead of making the Boolean operation one by one.
   This is achieved by introducing the `wrapDelta` and `wrapCount` in the `SweepEvent`.

The algorithm is used in two places in BP Studio:
1. Find the union of some axis-aligned polygons. This is for generating the "rough contour" of rivers.
2. Find the intersection of two rounded rectangles. This is for displaying invalid overlappings of flaps.
