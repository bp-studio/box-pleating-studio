# Test

This section contains the unit tests for BP Studio.

BP Studio specs and tests use [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/).
The preferred way to run them is by using the
[Mocha Test Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hbenl.vscode-mocha-test-adapter) extension of VS Code.
Alternatively, run `pnpm test` in the console to run all tests.
