> Super-complex origami design made easy!

## Introduction

Box pleating is arguably the standard framework of modern super-complex origami designs,
as the creases are much more predictable and manageable than those found in the traditional 22.5 degree system or circle packing.
Although pure box pleating is well-known for not being very efficient in utilizing paper area,
with the help of stretching gadgets (such as Kamiya patterns and the more generalized GOPS),
it is now possible for box pleating to achieve efficiency nearly as good as the optimal circle packing.
This app is created to help origami designers to blueprint their models in such systems.

## Acknowledgement

The author would like to specially thank the following people/parties, in no particular ordering:
- [Robert J. Lang](https://langorigami.com/) for his work that inspired the idea of GOPS,
and for his continuing support and encouragement throughout these years.
- [Lucas Tay Kiat Loong](https://cexplr.github.io/), for so eagerly volunteering to test BP Studio,
helping catching many critical and subtle bugs, and providing many invaluable feedbacks.
- [Jason S. Ku](https://github.com/origamimagiro), for his insights on the subject of computational geometry.
- Mat Groves and [GoodBoyDigital](https://www.goodboydigital.com), for maintaining [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/),
the graphics engine that powers BP Studio.
- [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/), for enrolling BP Studio into its Open Source Program.
It would be financially impossible for BP Studio to perform compatibility tests without it.
