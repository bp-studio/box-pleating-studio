# E2E

This section contains end-to-end tests for BP Studio.

We use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to perform E2E tests.
One can use the [Playwright Test for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright)
extension to run all tests.
Alternatively, run `pnpm e2e` in the console to run all tests.
